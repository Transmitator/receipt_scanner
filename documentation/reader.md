# Reader - *OCR and stuff*

Reader is meant to take an input image (eg. photo taken with a smartphone) and output formated contents of the scanned receipt. To achieve this goal it goes through the following steps:

#### Image preprocessing 
To help OCR module we preprocess images. 

#### Optical Character Recognition
For OCR we are using [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and [pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract).

#### Parsing string data according to a selected parsing strategy


#### Formating data into a standardised form.
