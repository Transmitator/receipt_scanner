## Building blocks
This project was divided into smaller parts:

- [Reader](./documentation/reader.md) - which provides all OCR functionalities. It takes your raw image and outputs formated contents of the receipt.

- [Main Service](./documentation/service.md) - it orchestrates the workflow of the entire application. 

- [Storage](./documentation/storage.md)
